## INTERESTING PROJECTS

* Mathematical simulations of physics and many kinds of videogames: Action, adventure, puzzles, mazes, 2D, 3D, and multi-player.
* Client-server architectures, distributed systems, communication protocols, interactive websites, e-commerce websites, and geographic information systems (GIS).
* Multimedia applications to generate graphics, 3D animations, sounds, and music. I programmed an artificial guitar player that plays guitar tablatures.
* “Classification and Detection of Nuclei in Histology Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks”, the final project of Big Data Analytics for Healthcare.
* Fractal Image Compression and Fractal Visual Analogies to solve Raven’s Progressive Matrices, the final project of Knowledge-Based Artificial Intelligence – Cognitive Systems.
* Learning patterns from financial indicators to trade stocks by using genetic algorithms and Q-Learning, the final project of Machine Learning for Trading. I plan to program the Monster Trader based on Deep Reinforcement Learning.
* Many robots that learn to move from scratch by using Deep Reinforcement Learning.
* For the course Artificial Intelligence for Robotics, I programmed Online Graph SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) with a variable amount of landmarks: https://youtu.be/owGo0SPAvR8. And I built a line-follower robot with Arduino: https://github.com/jckuri/line-follower-robot 
* 5 T-shirt designs by using neural style transfer: https://github.com/jckuri/project-t-shirt 
* New AI algorithms: Causal Router, Evolutionary Characterizer, Mental Image Reconstructor, Synergistic Pattern Generator, Flexible Applicability Finder, and Abstract SLAM.
* AGI system based on Fuster’s cognit theory (long-term project): http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Cortical_memory 
* A programming language which is symmetric, reflexive, and based on generative pattern matching. It will characterize patterns of mathematical thinking with which my artificial mathematician will reason.
* Edge Cameras for Detecting Human Presence (by using semantic segmentation) (Intel Edge AI Scholarship Program): https://github.com/jckuri/edge_cameras 
* Some projects of the OMS CS at Georgia Tech: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1s3sJwnzbJIFB7vXDDUGQOBzmZ2nraBK
