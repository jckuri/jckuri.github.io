## INTERESTING PROJECTS

* Many experiments and projects with computational intelligence: Datamining, graph search, neural networks, deep learning, expert systems, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms.
* Mathematical simulations of physics.
* Many videogames of many types: Action, adventure, puzzles, mazes, 3D, multi-player, etc.
* Artificial programmers (programs that autonomously generate other programs) and my own programming languages.
* Many projects with client-server architectures, distributed systems, and some communication protocols.
* Interactive websites, e-commerce websites, and geographic information systems (GIS).
* Multimedia applications to generate graphics, 3D animations, sounds, and music. I programmed an artificial guitar player that plays guitar tablatures. I am an amateur guitar player and singer.
* “Classification and Detection of Nuclei in Histology Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks”, the final project of Big Data Analytics for Healthcare.
* Fractal Image Compression and Fractal Visual Analogies to solve Raven’s Progressive Matrices, the final project of Knowledge-Based Artificial Intelligence – Cognitive Systems.
* Learning patterns from financial indicators to trade stocks by using genetic algorithms and Q-Learning, the final project of Machine Learning for Trading. I plan to build a ML system called Monster Trader, based on Deep Reinforcement Learning.
* Lunar Lander, the Project 2 of Reinforcement Learning. It’s about learning the causal geometries of continuous, complex, and chaotic real-world problems by using Deep Reinforcement Learning.
* For the course Artificial Intelligence for Robotics, I programmed Online Graph SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) with a variable amount of landmarks, as the final research challenge. And I built a line-follower robot with Arduino for the hardware challenge: [https://github.com/jckuri/line-follower-robot](https://github.com/jckuri/line-follower-robot)
* 5 T-shirt designs by using neural style transfer: [https://github.com/jckuri/project-t-shirt](https://github.com/jckuri/project-t-shirt)
* AI algorithms: Causal Router, Evolutionary Characterizer, Mental Image Reconstructor, Synergistic Pattern Generator, Mental Space Projector (Symmetry Detector, Kludge Generator, Flexible Applicability Finder), and Abstract SLAM.
* I plan to program an AGI system based on Fuster’s cognit theory. It’s a long-term project.
* A programming language which is symmetric, reflexive, and based on generative pattern matching. It will characterize patterns of mathematical thinking with which my artificial mathematician will reason.
* Edge Cameras for Detecting Human Presence (Intel Edge AI Scholarship Program) [https://github.com/jckuri/edge_cameras](https://github.com/jckuri/edge_cameras)
* Here are some of the projects I program at the Georgia Tech OMS CS: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1s3sJwnzbJIFB7vXDDUGQOBzmZ2nraBK](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1s3sJwnzbJIFB7vXDDUGQOBzmZ2nraBK)
