[Under construction...]

<h2>Summary:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Mathematical simulations of physics and many kinds of videogames: Action, adventure, puzzles, mazes, 2D, 3D, and multi-player.</li>
  <li>Client-server architectures, distributed systems, communication protocols, interactive websites, e-commerce websites, and geographic information systems (GIS).</li>
  <li>Multimedia applications to generate graphics, 3D animations, fractals, sounds, and music. I programmed an artificial guitar player that plays guitar tablatures.</li>
  <li>Many projects of artificial intelligence and deep learning.</li>
  <li>Agents that learn from scratch by using deep reinforcement learning, including AI trading.</li>
  <li>Many electronic circuits and electronic robots.</li>
  <li>Art generated by artificial intelligence.</li>
  <li>New AI algorithms: Causal Router, Evolutionary Characterizer, Mental Image Reconstructor, Synergistic Pattern Generator, Flexible Applicability Finder, and Abstract SLAM.</li>
  <li>AGI system based on Fuster’s cognit theory (long-term project): <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Cortical_memory">http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Cortical_memory</a> </li>
  <li>A programming language which is symmetric, reflexive, and based on generative pattern matching. It will characterize patterns of mathematical thinking with which my artificial mathematician will reason.</li>
</ul>

Some projects of the OMS CS at Georgia Tech:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1s3sJwnzbJIFB7vXDDUGQOBzmZ2nraBK 

“Classification and Detection of Nuclei in Histology Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks”, the final project of Big Data Analytics for Healthcare.

Fractal Image Compression and Fractal Visual Analogies to solve Raven’s Progressive Matrices, the final project of Knowledge-Based Artificial Intelligence – Cognitive Systems.

Learning patterns from financial indicators to trade stocks by using genetic algorithms and Q-Learning, the final project of Machine Learning for Trading. I plan to program the Monster Trader based on Deep Reinforcement Learning.

For the course Artificial Intelligence for Robotics, I programmed Online Graph SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) with a variable amount of landmarks: https://youtu.be/owGo0SPAvR8. 

I built a line-follower robot with Arduino: https://github.com/jckuri/line-follower-robot
